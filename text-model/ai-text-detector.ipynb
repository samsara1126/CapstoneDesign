While distance learning has several advantages, such as allowing students to learn at their own pace, providing flexibility in how and when they learn, and potentially reducing the cost of learning materials, there are also potential pitfalls that must be considered. Among these are the potential for increased bullying due to lack of direct supervision, as well as the potential distractedness and lack of social interaction associated with learning in an unstructured environment.\\n\\nAlthough distance learning provides many benefits, such as allowing students to have more control over their education, these same benefits can lead to greater responsibility for adolescents and, as a result, increased potential for irresponsibility. This could include dropping out of classes, excessive procrastination, or not following instructor directions, all of which will ultimately lead to a decline in educational performance. \\n\\nOne group of students that can especially benefit from distance learning are those with extra responsibilities after school or those looking to save money. Not having to worry about expensive transportation to and from campus, as well as the freedom to take classes at different times of the day, can be incredibly liberating and allow students to focus on their studies. Additionally, distance learning can be an excellent way to fit education into a tight schedule while still advancing one\\u2019s academic goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning is an attractive learning option that can provide students with much needed flexibility, particularly those with extra responsibilities, but it is not without its own set of challenges. Evaluating the potential pros and cons of distance learning can help students make an educated decision about the learning option that is best for them.\",\n          \"\\nRalph Waldo Emerson's words, \\\"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,\\\" have inspired generations of thinkers to push beyond their comfort zones in search of personal and professional growth. This idea can be applied across a variety of professions, such as entrepreneurs who must have the courage to move into uncharted waters in order to create something new, academics who must stretch the boundaries of existing knowledge, and artists who take risks in their work in order to break new ground. While professional sports players may also strive to expand their skills and knowledge for the sake of progress, they are somewhat of an exception to the rule. This is because a successful sports career is often based upon rigorous practice and training within a pre-established environment. However, even athletes must periodically challenge themselves to innovate in order to stay competitive. Looking beyond the realms of athletics, examples of individuals being pushed out of their comfort zones for growth can be seen in numerous scenarios. From corporate CEOs looking for novel solutions to global problems, to everyday people looking to break free from limiting circumstances, the necessity of venturing outside of one's safely constructed realm of knowledge is a recurring theme.\",\n          \"Sometime in life , if we dont try new stuff, we will never succeed. The author, Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,\\\" Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow\\\", and i agree with him.\\n\\nSometimes in life to succeed , you have to be passioned.\\n\\nIf you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.\\n\\nIf you want to grow in life , you can't be scared,\\n\\nsometimes for being scared of learning or asking a question, we miss big opportunities and stay stuck, also, dont be scared of what other people think about you.\\n\\nOther people might say that if you are good in life right now , why would you want to learn something new?, and you have tell them that you want succeed in life,be better person, not like the average people that dont do nothing to be better in life.\\n\\nMany times to grow and succeed in life, we have to try new things, we cant be stuck in the same thing for our whole entire life. The statement that Ralph waldo Emerson wrote, is very true and i agree with him, if we dont try new stuff , we wont grow in life. we have to be more passioned of our life and start looking for new stuff to learn, and stop being scared of learning because we are missing big opportunities.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["texts  = df[\"text\"].tolist()\n","labels = df[\"label\"].tolist()\n","\n","train_texts, test_texts, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(\n","    texts,\n","    labels,\n","    test_size=0.2,\n","    random_state=42,\n","    stratify=labels\n",")\n","\n","print(len(train_texts), len(test_texts))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-9UtLnKm_xwC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764521620950,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"박현빈","userId":"08791733427239117904"}},"outputId":"de9c34c4-eb77-489e-e560-47c467292baf"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["3873 969\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["max_features = 2000  #
